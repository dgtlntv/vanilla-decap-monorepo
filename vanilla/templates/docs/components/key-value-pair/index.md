# Key/Value pair

\[TOC]

# Overview

The key/value component is used to list a number of values with their corresponding keys. It’s widely used when listing properties for a complex element or for a collection of similarly grouped elements (i.e. servers or subscriptions). 

# Anatomy

The component is made of a heading for the key that is on top and a paragraph text for the value that is under.

# Usage

## When to use

Use this component to organise information that requires grouping together a set of values and their keys. 

## When not to use

This component may not always address all requirements.  For instance, when the user is required to scan the keys or the values of a long list of items, it is highly recommended to use the List component.

## Vertical stack

### Definition

This variant stacks vertically the pair of a key and its value. 

Values in this variant can be wrapped into more than 2 lines.

### The look

### Usage

#### When to use

Use this variant when you have one or more of the following constraints:

* the width is too narrow to show columns
* you have long keys (that would wrap in columns)
* You have long values that can’t be wrapped or truncated (e.g. Mac address)

#### when not to use (and recommandations)

Don’t use this variant when you have one or more of the following constraints:

* the width is big enough to show the ‘rack columns’ variant
* there is a long list of items, use the existing ‘list’ pattern (left aligned keys by default), with a divider when you have a mix of long and short labels
* the user needs to quickly scan keys of values only, use the existing ‘list’ pattern (left aligned keys by default), with a divider when you have a mix of long and short labels
* the user needs to be able to compare values, use a table or a list. 
* The keys are short (they don’t wrap in columns) with short values. In this case it’s preferable to use a horizontal stack.

### Behaviours

* The ‘rack’ variant is static and doesn’t have any hover or click behaviour. 
* Its text can be selected and copied as any other text.

### Example

#### UA Purchase

## Horizontal stack

### Definition

The horizontal stack variant expands horizontally the key/value pair.

It can be extended into 2 or more columns according to the available space. \
Values in this variant can’t be wrapped in more than 2 lines. 

If values are longer than 2 lines, we recommend to use the vertical rack variant or truncate the end of the value with ‘...’

### Usage

#### When to use

This is the default variant when the layout doesn’t show values that wrap into more than 2 rows. Use this variant when you have one or more of the following constraints:

* the width is big enough to show columns: Use the same logic than [grids](https://vanillaframework.io/docs/patterns/grid) to split into columns
* you have short keys (that don’t wrap in columns) and short values ( or that can be wrapped and truncated into 2 lines maximum)

#### when not to use (and recommandations)

Don’t use this variant when you have one or more of the following constraints:

* the width is two narrow to show columns
* the keys are long(that would wrap in columns)
* values are long or can’t be wrapped and truncated into 2 lines maximum
* the list of items is long \
  then use the existing ‘list’ pattern (left aligned keys by default), with a divider when you have a mix of long and short labels
* the user needs to quickly scan keys of values only \
  then use the existing ‘list’ pattern (left aligned keys by default), with a divider when you have a mix of long and short labels
* you need to compare values. In this case it’s preferable to use a table or a List view with left aligned keys/Values

### Behaviours

* The ‘rack column’ variant is static and doesn’t have any hover or click behaviour. 
* Its text can be selected and copied as any other text.
* Use line-wrapping when using longer value strings so the width of all similar components in one view is equal.
* The number of columns can vary according to the width of the area, the device and the sizes of keys and values.
* All columns should have the same width.
* It will follow the responsive behaviour of grids. When it wraps, there is less column and more pairs will stack per column.
